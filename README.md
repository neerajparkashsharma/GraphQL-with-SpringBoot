# GraphQL-with-SpringBoot
This README file provides a basic guide to set up and run a Spring Boot application with GraphQL functionality. The application will allow you to interact with a GraphQL API. 

## Prerequisites
Before proceeding, ensure you have the following installed:

* Java JDK (Java 8 or above)
* Apache Maven
* Your favorite IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse) with Spring Boot support
* A GraphQL client (e.g., Postman, Insomnia) for testing the API

## Getting Started
Follow the steps below to set up the Spring Boot application:

* **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository containing the Spring Boot project from the provided URL.

* **Import Project**: Import the project into your IDE as a Maven project.

* **Build the Project**: Build the project using Maven to download the dependencies and compile the code.
 

*  **GraphQL Dependencies**: Add the required GraphQL dependencies to the pom.xml file:

```
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-graphql</artifactId>
</dependency>

<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.graphql</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-graphql-test</artifactId>
  <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```
